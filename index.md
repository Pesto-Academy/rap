# The Pesto Group 

#### U.S. Department of Labor
## Registered Apprenticeship Program

#### The Pesto Group's NorthCoast.Work team is formalizing its software engineering and quality assurance apprenticeship program by building a Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP). A robust talent pipeline will emerge delivering a diverse and highly skilled workforce. This innovative application of RAP will scale to other companies across Michigan and the U.S. 

For information on the U.S. Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship program, see [Apprenticeship.gov](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/)

For information on Michigan's RAP efforts, see [LEO - Registered Apprenticeships](https://www.michigan.gov/leo/bureaus-agencies/wd/apprenticeships)

This RAP [Appendix A](ThePestoGroup_AppendixA.pdf) outlines the occupational standards that define this workforce development experience.
