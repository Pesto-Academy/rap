### 1.1 SUMMARY

<details>
<summary>How is Debian GNU/Linux different from Ubuntu? Name two aspects.</summary>
Ubuntu is based on a snapshot of Debian, therefore there are many similarities between them.
However, there are still significant differences between them. The first one would be the
applicability for beginners. Ubuntu is recommended for beginners because of its ease of use
and on the other hand Debian is recommended for more advanced users. The major difference
is the complexity of the user configuration that Ubuntu doesnâ€™t require during the installation
process.
Another difference would be the stability of each distribution. Debian is considered to be more
stable compared to Ubuntu. This is because Debian receives fewer updates that are tested in
detail and the entire operating system is more stable. On the other hand, Ubuntu enables the
user to use the latest releases of software and all the new technologies.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>What are the most common environments/platforms Linux is used for? Name three different
environments/platforms and name one distribution you can use for each.</summary>
A few of the common environments/platforms would be smartphone, desktop and server. On
smartphones, it can be used by distributions such as Android. On desktop and server, it can be
used by any distribution that is mostly suitable with the functionality of that machine, from
Debian, Ubuntu to CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>You are planning to install a Linux distribution in a new environment. Name four things that
you should consider when choosing a distribution.</summary>
When choosing a distribution, a few of the main things that should be considered is cost,
performance, scalability, how stable it is and the hardware demand of the system.
4. Name three devices that the Android OS runs on, other than smartphones.
Other devices that Android runs on are smart TVs, tablet computers, Android Auto and
smartwatches.

<details>
<summary>Explain three major advantages of cloud computing.</summary>
The major advantages of cloud computing are flexibility, easy to recover and low use cost.
Cloud based services are easy to implement and scale, depending on the business
requirements. It has a major advantage in backup and recovery solutions, as it enables
businesses to recover from incidents faster and with less repercussions. Furthermore, it
reduces operation costs, as it allows to pay just for the resources that a business uses, on a
subscription-based model.
